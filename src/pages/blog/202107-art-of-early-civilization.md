**Art of the Fertile Crescent**

Civilization developed in a few great river valleys where deposits of rich soil produced abundant harvests so people could settle and create villages. One of these villages extended about 280 km north of the Persian Gulf, between the Tigris and Euphrates River. Because of the fertile land and warm climate it was known as the Fertile Crescent. It is known as Mesopotamia (the eastern part of the Fertile Crescent) attracted settlers.

Sumerian Civilization

Sometime before 4500 B.C., Sumerians (who were nomads), settled in a part of Mesopotamia that was called Sumer. They farmed and built homes and created a community. They are believed to have invented wheeled transportation and the potter’s wheel. Their cooperative lifestyle formed a government and set of laws.

Ziggurats: Symbolic Mountains

Each Sumerian city was built around a shrine called a ziggurat (a stepped mountain made of brick covered earth).  This was a structure that symbolically linked the earthbound worshippers with heavenly gods.

Sumerian Decorative Arts

Much of the evidence of art objects comes from the ancient cemetery where burial sites were found filled with chariots, jewelry, headdresses, sculpture and musical instruments. Combining human and animal features was a common practice in their art objects and the imagery of the bull was common as well.

Evolution of Writing

Sumerian writing (through pictures and symbols) is one of the first we have found. They wrote on clay tablets with a writing instrument called a stylus.  The wedge-shaped character writing is called cuneiform. The clay tablets were then baked and in this way contracts, records, and cultural stories were handed down.

Akkadian Period

Northwest of the Sumerians lived a Semitic people in an area called Akkas and they had a king that eventually ruled over Sumer as well. Although this ruling period was short lived, art and literature flourished.

Symbolism in Akkadian Art

Neo-Sumerian Period

Akkadian dominance in Mesopotamia ended around 2150 B.C. The revival (known as the Neo-Sumerian period) lasted more than 300 years. The most famous ruler of the Neo-Sumerian people was Gudea who was honoured for his devotion to literature, religion and good works.  He built temples, promoted education and showed compassion for the less fortunate. He was worshipped as a god after he died and his appearance has been captured in many portraits.

Babylonian Civilization

Around 1800 B.C. after centuries of war with the Mesopotamian city states the Babylonians, under the rule of their king, Hammurabi, gained control of Mesopotamia. King Hammurabi is famous for his code of legal practices that he published on a stele (an inscribed stone pillar), in a public area for all to see. The code was a set of rules accompanied by the appropriate punishment.

Assyrian Civilization

When this king died there was chaos for a while until the powerful Assyrians from the north rose to power around 900 B.C. They ruled until the early 7th century. The most impressive visual records of the Assyrians are the stone reliefs used to cover the mud-brick walls of their royal palaces.

Neo-Babylonian Period

Early in the 7th century, under the rule of King Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian supremacy was re-kindled. Unfortunately, the temples and other structures erected were made of clay and crumbled easily, so we don’t have them today. The Ishtar Gate was the only surviving example of architecture from this time. It was named after a goddess and is one of eight gateways marking a procession route that curled through Babylon. When this King died in 562 B.C. his empire only lasted about another 30 years, before it too crumbled.

Persian Empire

Egypt, Babylonia and Assyria were many centuries old when a vigorous people appeared and they called themselves Irani (their new homeland is now called Iran). They were mistakenly called Persians (because some Greek geographers named them after a territory known as Parsa). In 539 B.C., the Persians captured the city of Babylon, without a fight, and made it their capital.  This lasted until 331 B.C. when they were conquered by Alexander the Great.

Persian Architecture and Relief Carving

Palaces are the highest accomplishment of Persian Architecture. The remains of the great audience hall at Persepolis is in ruins today.  It contained 100, 65 foot columns, ornate wooden ceilings and a huge audience hall. Unlike the military scenes shown on Assyrian reliefs, Persian carvings portray people bringing tributes and offerings to the king. When Alexander the Great marched into the city in 331. B.C. he destroyed this magnificent palace. 

Art has been in our world since the beginning of time. We may not realize it but art has been evolving. Nowadays, art has turned away from classical tradition, embracing new media and aesthetic ideals.
